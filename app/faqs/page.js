          <p>• Where you operate a small business from your home, there may be some tax benefits available. In the March 2023 budget, the government amended the rules so that businesses can claim a 100% first year capital allowance on the cost of purchasing and installing solar panels, meaning part of the cost of the installation may be able to be deducted from taxable profit in the first year.</p>
